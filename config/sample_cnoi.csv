Any increases or reductions in this reserve are recognized in provision for credit losses. Allowance for Credit Losses On January 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 ""Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326)"". ASU 2016-13 was effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020.  Under Section 4014 of the CARES Act, financial institutions required to adopt ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2020 were provided an option to delay the adoption of the CECL framework. The Company elected to defer adoption of CECL until January 1, 2021. This standard requires that the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This standard requires financial institutions and other organizations to use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. ​ The adoption of the CECL Standard resulted in an initial decrease of $3.9 million to the allowance for credit losses and an increase of $1.4 million to the reserve for unfunded commitments. The after-tax cumulative-effect adjustment of $1.7 million was recorded as an increase to retained earnings as of January 1, 2021. ​ A provision of $5.4 million and $6.2 million were recorded during the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $5.4 million provision for credit losses recognized in 2022 was associated with growth in the loan portfolio and a deterioration of forecased economic conditions, offset by a reduction in reserves on individually analyzed loans and unfunded commitments. The $6.2 million provision for credit losses recognized in 2021 included a provision recorded on acquired non-PCD loans for the Day 2 accounting of acquired loans from the Merger offset by improvements in forecasted macroeconomic conditions, and release of reserves on individually analyzed loans.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Dime Community Bancshares, Inc., a New York corporation, is a bank holding company formed in 1988. On a parent-only basis, the Holding Company has minimal operations, other than as owner of Dime Community Bank. The Holding Company is dependent on dividends from its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dime Community Bank, its own earnings, additional capital raised, and borrowings as sources of funds. The information in this report reflects principally the financial condition and results of operations of the Bank. The Bank's results of operations are primarily dependent on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. The Bank also generates non-interest income, such as fee income on deposit and loan accounts, merchant credit and debit card processing programs, loan swap fees, investment services, income from its title insurance subsidiary, and net gains on sales of securities and loans. The level of non-interest expenses, such as salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and administrative expenses, expenses from the Bank’s title insurance subsidiary, and income tax expense, further affects our net income. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts and the related discussion and analysis to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not have an impact on net income or total stockholders' equity.

These accounting policies may require various levels of subjectivity, estimates or judgment by management. Policies with respect to the methodologies it uses to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and fair value of loans acquired in a business combination are critical accounting policies because they are important to the presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These critical accounting estimates involve a significant degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often necessitate assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. The use of different judgments, assumptions or estimates could result in material variations in the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has reviewed the following critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with its Audit Committee. Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans Held for Investment Methods and Assumptions Underlying the Estimate The allowance for credit losses is established and maintained through a provision for credit losses based on expected losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis, and additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are charged against the allowance. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In determining the allowance for credit losses for loans that share similar risk characteristics, the Company utilizes a model which compares the amortized cost basis of the loan to the net present value of expected cash flows to be collected. Expected credit losses are determined by aggregating the individual cash flows and calculating a loss percentage by loan segment, or pool, for loans that share similar risk characteristics. For a loan that does not share risk characteristics with other loans, the Company will evaluate the loan on an individual basis. Within the model, assumptions are made in the determination of probability of default, loss given default, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, prepayment rate, curtailment rate, and recovery lag periods. Management assesses the sensitivity of key assumptions at least annually by stressing the assumptions to understand the impact on the model. Statistical regression is utilized to relate historical macro-economic variables to historical credit loss experience of a peer group of banks that operate in and around Dime’s footprint. These models are then utilized to forecast future expected loan losses based on expected future behavior of the same macro-economic variables. Adjustments to the quantitative results are made using qualitative factors. These factors include: (1) lending policies and procedures and the experience, ability, and depth of the lending management and other relevant staff; (2) international, national, regional and local economic business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various markets; (3) the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; (4) the volume and severity of past due loans; (5) the quality of our loan review system; (6) the value of underlying collateral for collateralized loans; (7) the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; and (8) the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing port",24.83

Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments We maintain a reserve, recorded in other liabilities, associated with unfunded loan commitments accepted by the borrower. The amount of reserve was $2.7 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This reserve is determined based upon the outstanding volume of unfunded loan commitments at each period end. Any increases or reductions in this reserve are recognized in provision for credit losses. Allowance for Credit Losses Provision for credit losses of $36.1 million and $2.8 million were recorded during the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $36.1 million provision for credit losses recognized in 2024 was related to additional provisioning for the pooled multifamily, C&I, and criticized loan portfolios. The $2.8 million provision for credit losses recognized in 2023 was associated with provisioning for individually analyzed loans.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Company’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 contains a summary of significant accounting policies. These critical accounting estimates involve a significant degree of complexity and require management to make difficult subjective judgments which often necessitate assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Policies with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and are important to the presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations. The use of different judgments, assumptions or estimates could result in material variations in the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has reviewed the following critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with its Audit Committee. Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans Held for Investment Methods and Assumptions Underlying the Estimate The allowance for credit losses is established and maintained through a provision for credit losses based on expected losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis, and additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are charged against the allowance. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In determining the allowance for credit losses for loans that share similar risk characteristics, the Company utilizes a model which compares the amortized cost basis of the loan to the net present value of expected cash flows to be collected. Expected credit losses are determined by aggregating the individual cash flows and calculating a loss percentage by loan segment, or pool, for loans that share similar risk characteristics. For a loan that does not share risk characteristics with other loans, the Company will evaluate the loan on an individual basis. Within the model, assumptions are made in the determination of probability of default, loss given default, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, prepayment rate, curtailment rate, and recovery lag periods. Statistical regression is utilized to relate historical macro-economic variables to historical credit loss experience of a peer group of banks that operate in and around Dime’s footprint. These models are then utilized to forecast future expected loan losses based on expected future behavior of the same macro-economic variables. Adjustments to the quantitative results are made using qualitative factors, which are subjective and require significant management judgment. These factors include: (1) lending policies and procedures and the experience, ability, and depth of the lending management and other relevant staff; (2) international, national, regional and local economic business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various markets; (3) the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; (4) the volume and severity of past due loans; (5) the quality of our loan review system; (6) the value of underlying collateral for collateralized loans; (7) the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; and (8) the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio. Although management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the Allowance for Credit Loss, management assesses the sensitivity of key quantitative assumptions including macroeconomic forecasts and prepayment rate assumptions.

Segment pretax profit or loss is used to assess the performance of the mortgage banking segment by monitoring the premium received on loan sales. Loans, investments, and deposits provide the revenues in the banking operation. Loans, and deposits provide the revenues in mortgage banking, and loan sales provide the revenues in mortgage banking.  Interest expense, provisions for credit losses, and payroll provide the significant expenses in the banking operation, payroll expenses provide the significant expense in mortgage banking, and interest expense, employee benefits, and acquisition expenses provide the significant expenses for the holding company operations.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of FNCB Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of FNCB Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for the years then ended and the related notes (collectively, the ""consolidated financial statements""). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for the recognition and measurement of credit losses as of January 1, 2023 due to the adoption of ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses . Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 45 Table of Contents Allowance for Loan Losses – Quali",18.83

Arrow adopted on January 1, 2021, Accounting Standards Updates (‘‘ASU’’) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (‘‘CECL’’) and its related amendments. The CECL approach requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). The estimate of expected credit losses under the CECL approach is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. Arrow then considers whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period from which historical experience was used.  Finally, Arrow considers forecasts about future economic conditions that are reasonable and supportable. The allowance for losses on unfunded commitments represents the expected credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. However, a liability is not recognized for commitments unconditionally cancellable by Arrow. The allowance for losses on unfunded commitments is determined by estimating future draws and applying the expected loss rates on those draws.  Arrow considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for credit losses to be a critical accounting estimate given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover Arrow's estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolio.  Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods.  While management’s current evaluation of the allowance for credit losses indicates that the allowance is appropriate at this time, the allowance may need to be increased in the future due to changes in conditions or assumptions. The impact of utilizing the CECL approach to calculate the reserve for credit losses will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Material changes to these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the reserve for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility to our reported earnings.

The increase between time periods results from the strength that this segment provides to the Company which was determined by a thorough funds transfer pricing analysis. In short, a funds transfer pricing analysis determines how funding (deposits) and use of this funding (loans) by each segment contributes to the overall profitability of the Company by providing an estimated positive or negative dollar value of the segment’s contribution to the Company. Overall, the funds transfer pricing analysis indicated that the community banking segment provided a $2.0 million benefit to the Company. Despite the benefit that community banking provides, this segment was unfavorably impacted from net interest margin compression as total deposit interest expense increased to a higher level than the increase to total loan interest income. This segment continues to benefit from increased yields on loans due to a higher U.S. Treasury yield curve and the Federal Reserve’s action to tighten monetary policy. However, the increased national interest rates have recently caused total deposit costs to increase to a higher degree. The Company benefitted from a higher level of total average loans in the first quarter of 2023. Growth in commercial & industrial loans (C&I) and home equity loans more than offset decreased residential mortgage and consumer loans. Commercial real estate (CRE) volume remained relatively consistent, increasing slightly. This segment did benefit from an additional $187,000 of total loan charge income which partially offset a decline in PPP processing fees and interest. The Company recognized $240,000 of PPP related income in the first quarter of 2022 and did not recognize any PPP related income in 2023. Overall, total loan interest income improved by $2.8 million, or 29.3%, for the first quarter of 2023 when compared to the first quarter of last year. Deposit interest expense was higher by $3.4 million, or 426.3%, despite the first quarter 2023 average volume of total interest bearing deposits remaining relatively consistent with the 2022 first quarter average, growing by $5.3 million, or 0.6%. The impact that the higher national interest rates had on deposit costs combined with increased market competition to retain and attract deposits contributed to net interest margin compression. This segment was unfavorably impacted by the Company recording $301,000 of expense for the allowance for credit losses on our loan portfolio in the first quarter of 2023 compared to a $400,000 recovery for loan losses in last year’s first quarter. This was  discussed previously in the Provision for Credit Losses section within this document. Non-interest income was unfavorably impacted by the recognition of a $96,000 credit valuation adjustment to the market value of the interest rate swap contracts that the Company executed to accommodate the needs of certain commercial borrowers while managing our interest rate risk position. Also, unfavorably impacting non-interest income was a reduced level of loan sale gain income by $69,000 due to the lower level of residential mortgage loan production in 2023. Non-interest expense, within the community banking segment, in the first quarter of 2023 compares favorably to last year’s first quarter as reduced pension expense, explained in Note 16, and lower incentive compensation more than offset higher salaries cost.

See “Non-GAAP to GAAP Reconciliations and Calculation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions to meet the financing needs of clients, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in the consolidated balance sheets. These transactions include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Most of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon. All off-balance sheet commitments are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We decrease our exposure to losses under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. We assess the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establishes a liability for probable credit losses. Further information related to financial instruments can be found in Note 15 (Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk) in the notes to the consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this report. Liquidity Liquidity management is the process by which we manage the flow of funds necessary to meet our financial commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost and to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities. These financial commitments include withdrawals by depositors, credit commitments to borrowers, expenses of our operations, and capital expenditures. Liquidity is monitored and closely managed by our asset and liability committee, or ALCO, a group of senior officers from the finance, enterprise risk management, deposit, investment, treasury, and lending areas. It is ALCO’s responsibility to ensure we have the necessary level of funds available for normal operations as well as maintain a contingency funding policy to ensure that potential liquidity stress events are planned for, quickly identified, and management has plans in place to respond. ALCO has created policies which establish limits and require measurements to monitor liquidity trends, including modeling and management reporting that identifies the amounts and costs of all available funding sources. 85",14.54

CECL was expected to result in earlier recognition of credit losses and required consideration of not only past and current events but also reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability.  The Bank became subject to the new standard in the first quarter of 2020.  Concurrent with the enactment of the CARES Act, federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL.  The interim final rule provided banking organizations that implemented CECL prior to the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital relative to regulatory capital determined under the prior incurred loss methodology, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay.  The CECL standard requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses.   See Note 2 - Accounting Standards Recently Adopted or Issued and Note 6 - Allowance for Credit Losses in the Company's Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's adoption of CECL and the corresponding allowance for credit losses.",16.14

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. ​ Basis for Opinion ​ These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. ​ We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. ​ ​ Critical Audit Matter ​ The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. ​ ​ Allowance for Loan Losses – Qualitative Factors ​ As more fully described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates and records an allowance for loan losses for loans collectively evaluated for impairment by developing a loss rate based on historical losses and qualitative factors. Qualitative factors are used to adjust historical loss rates considering relevant factors such as national and local economic trends and conditions; levels and trends in delinquency rates and non-accrual loans; trends in volumes and terms of loans; effects of changes in lending policies; experience, ability, and depth of lending staff; value of underlying collateral; and 57",15.17

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, to meet the financing needs of its customers, the Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, lines of credit, and standby letters of credit. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. The credit risks inherent in loan commitments and letters of credit are essentially the same as those involved in extending loans to customers, and these arrangements are subject to our normal credit policies. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. We generally require collateral or other security to support the financial instruments with credit risk. The amount of collateral or other security is determined based on management’s credit evaluation of the counterparty. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. Loan commitments and letters of credit totaled $251.3 million and $16.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024. Management does not believe that any of the foregoing arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. We are not a party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on these arrangements. Capital Resources We require capital to fund loans, satisfy our obligations under the Bank’s letters of credit, meet the deposit withdraw demands of the Bank’s customers, and satisfy our other monetary obligations. To the extent that deposits are not adequate to fund our capital requirements, we can rely on the funding sources identified below under the heading “Liquidity Management”.  At December 31, 2024, the Bank had $140.0 million available through unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks, $36.6 million net available through a secured line of credit with the Federal Reserve Discount Window and approximately $213.6 million net available through the FHLB.  Management is not aware of any demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are likely to materially affect our ability to meet our future capital requirements. In addition to operational requirements, the Bank and the Corporation are subject to risk-based capital regulations, which were adopted and are monitored by federal banking regulators. These regulations are used to evaluate capital adequacy and require an analysis of an institution’s asset risk profile and off-balance sheet exposures, such as unused loan commitments and stand-by letters of credit. Detailed information about these capital regulations and their requirements is set forth in the “Supervision and Regulation” section of Item 1 of Part I of this annual report under the heading “Capital Requirements”. At December 31, 2024, the Corporation’s total risk-based capital ratio was 15.92% and the Bank’s total risk-based capital ratio was 14.59%, both of which were well above the regulatory minimum of 8%. The total risk-based capital ratios of the Corporation and the Bank at December 31, 2023 were 15.64% and 14.05%, respectively. At December 31, 2024, the most recent notification from the regulators categorizes the Bank as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.
